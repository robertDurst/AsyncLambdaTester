# AsyncLambdaTester
AsyncLambdaTester is a novel test generator for asynchronous, higher-order functions written in JavaScript. 

This is a fork of [LambdaTester](https://github.com/sola-da/LambdaTester). See their [OOPSLA 2018 paper](http://software-lab.org/publications/oopsla2018_LambdaTester.pdf) for a detailed description.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>v6)
- Install required npm modules with `npm install`

## Overview

Directories in this repository:
1. **setupCode** - two files: *setupArray.js* the setup code to generate tests for array polyfills and *setupPromise.js*, the setup code to generate tests for promises.
2. **utilities** - utility files for test generation 

## Test Generation

Explanation of required inputs:

- function names: names of methods under test (e.g., reduce)
- number of tests: number of tests to be generated
- setup code: file containing setup code. To test array methods use setupCode/setupArray.js and to test promise methods use setupCode/setupPromise.js 
- is feedback directed: indicates whether callback position inference and the feedback are part of test generation (0 – no, 1 – yes). To generate tests with Base approach choose 0.
- callback type: 
     0 - empty callback (Cb-Empty approach)
     1 - callback generated by quickcheck (Cb-Quick approach) 
     2 - use mined callbacks (Cb-Mined approach)
     3 - use callbacks generated based on dynamic analysis of memory reads (Cb-Writes approach)
- run with dynamic analysis: indicates whether the dynamic analysis of memory reads is used during test generation (0 – no, 1 – yes)
- test folder: a path to a folder to put generated tests
- polyfills to analyze (optional): This is an optional input and should be specified only if the test generator uses dynamic analysis for callback generation. Specifies paths to polyfills that are dynamically analyzed.
