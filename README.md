# AsyncLambdaTester
AsyncLambdaTester is a novel test generator for asynchronous, higher-order functions written in JavaScript. 

This is a fork of [LambdaTester](https://github.com/sola-da/LambdaTester). See their [OOPSLA 2018 paper](http://software-lab.org/publications/oopsla2018_LambdaTester.pdf) for a detailed description.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>v6)
- Install required npm modules with `npm install` or `yarn` if you're hip and cool 😎

## Overview

Directories in this repository:
1. **setupCode** - two files: *setupArray.js* the setup code to generate tests for array polyfills and *setupPromise.js*, the setup code to generate tests for promises.
2. **utilities** - utility files for test generation 
3. **callbackMining** - the collection of mined callbacks and callbackProvider.js script to return callbacks for requested method



## Test Generation

Invoked with the following command:

`node testGeneration.js [INPUTS]`

Explanation of **INPUTS** (all required unless marked as OPTIONAL):

| Name | Index | Description | Accepted Types/Values|
|----|----|----|----|
| function names | 0 | names of methods under test (e.g. reduce) | string |
| number of tests | 1 | number of tests to be generated | number |
| setup code | 2 |  file containing setup code. To test array methods use setupCode/setupArray.js and to test promise methods use setupCode/setupPromise.js | string |
| is feedback directed? | 3 | indicates whether callback position inference and the feedback are part of test generation | boolean number: (0 – no, 1 – yes) to generate tests with Base approach choose 0. | 
| callback type | 4 | (see below) | number |
|run with dynamic analysis? | 5 | indicates whether the dynamic analysis of memory reads is used during test generation | boolean number |
| test folder | 6 | a path to a folder to put generated tests in | string |
| polyfills to analyze (OPTIONAL) | 7 | hould be specified only if the test generator uses dynamic analysis for callback generation. Specifies paths to polyfills that are dynamically analyzed. | string |

### Possible callback types: 
    0 - empty callback (Cb-Empty approach)
    1 - callback generated by quickcheck (Cb-Quick approach) 
    2 - use mined callbacks (Cb-Mined approach)
    3 - use callbacks generated based on dynamic analysis of memory reads (Cb-Writes approach)
